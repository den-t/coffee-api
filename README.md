# **COFFEE API**

## RESTful API PROVIDING COFFEE DATA

### **What is COFFEE API?**
It is an open source RESTful API providing many coffee data.

### **What type of data?**
You can consume data as coffee beverages (latte, espresso, cappuccino, cortado and many others).

### **What’s the purpose of this project?**
We built this project because we love coffee. So, if you are a developer and a coffee lover, we want it to share this data to you to use it in your projects for free.

It was a challenge for us to built this. We decided to implement product variants concept into our database. So, you can choose between a simple 12oz latte or a vainilla 12oz latte. It is just one product with two variants.

You can implement it in you personal projects or commercial projects. Please, feel free to let us know what improvements we can make and if we miss a type of coffee that you know or like let us know also to include it into our database.

**Let’s build!**
